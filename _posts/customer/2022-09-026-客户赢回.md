> Customer Win-Back Strategies to Redeem Relationships

<img src="/img/customer/winback/customer-winback-stratagies-header.jpeg">
In romantic comedies, the male protagonist often makes an attempt to win back the heart of 
his lady with an over-the-top gesture that is sure to capture her attention and love.

When it comes to mobile businesses attempting to win back the hearts of customers who no longer use their app, a similar gesture must be made — albeit less romantic.

On average, a mobile app will lose 77% of its daily active users (DAU) within the first 3 days after installation. 
That number continues to increase over time: up to 90% within the first month and over 95% after three months.

> 在浪漫喜剧片中，男主角为了获取他追求的女士的芳心，经常做一些能够获取她的注意和爱情的浮夸姿势，
> 同样的场景出现在移动商业场景中，虽然不那么浪费。当顾客不再使用他们的app时，需要赢回顾客的芳心。
> 平均而言，一个移动app一般在客户安装3天后会失去77%的DAU。这个数字持续增长：在第一个月达到90%，并且在第三个月达到95%。

### What is a Win-Back Strategy?
A win-back strategy is exactly what it sounds like 
— a calculated marketing plan to get those DAUs who dropped off back on your app, retain them as active users, and help keep your churn rate low.

Churn rate, the percentage of users who stop using an app during a given period, 
is detrimental to the success of your platform. In order to have a successful app, the number of new users must be higher than the number of users who leave.

Not only does churn stifle the growth of your app, but it’s expensive as well.

> ### 赢回策略是什么？
> 就如它的名字一样，赢回策略是指：一个可计算的市场营销计划能够重拾这些DAU，让这些客户能够重新使用你的app，成为有效的客户，让客户流失率持续保持的低位。
> 客户流失率，是指在一段时间内停止使用一个应用的客户占比。这个指标阻碍了你的平台的成功。为了打造有一个成功的app，新客户的数量必须要大于流失的客户数量，。
> 客户流失不但阻碍了你的app的成长，而且它也打来非常昂贵的成本。

<img src="/img/customer/winback/why-customer-winback-strategies-are-important-for-churn-rate.jpeg">

You can think of churn as a leaking bucket: The water is coming out of the bucket faster than you can fill it back up, 
and the cost of refilling that bucket can be high.

While it can be difficult to develop the right win-back strategy for your particular audience, it’s worth the effort.
Acquiring a new customer can be up to 25x more expensive than retaining an existing customer, meaning re-engaging a dormant user can help improve your bottom line.

It’s still important to put effort into acquiring new users or customers for growth, 
but it’s equally important to continue adding value to the customers already in your database.

Win-back campaigns and strategies are an effective way of reinvigorating your dormant users, 
helping improve your customer lifetime value.  


> 你可以把客户流失想象为一个漏水的桶：水流出的速度快于你加水的速度，并且你加水的成本可能会很高。
> 
> 虽然为你的这部分特殊的受众研究出正确的赢回策略可能会非常困难，但是值得努力尝试。
> 
> 获取一个新客户可能需要比保持一个现有客户多25倍的花费，这意味着重新召回1个沉默的客户能帮助改善你的最终盈利。
> 
> 当然，为了发展壮大，努力获取新客户仍然值得努力，但是同等重要的是持续为你的现存客户增加价值。
> 
> 赢回战略和战术的目的就是有效的使你的沉默客户再次活跃的方法，帮助提高客户终生价值。（这是一个可以计算的指标，如何计算，以后再详解）

### 01. RFM Analysis
    
RFM (recency, frequency, monetary) analysis is a marketing model that highlights 
segments of customer behavior based on their history with your product. 
These metrics can help you decide which win-back strategies to implement 
by looking at who your best customers are and which ones contribute to your churn rate.

This analysis helps marketers answer questions like:

Who are your best and most active users (i.e. your power users)?
Who has the potential to become a more valuable customer?
Which of your customers are most likely to respond to your win-back tactics?
Once these questions are answered, the RFM analysis can help determine which at-risk customers 
might need to be targeted in a win-back campaign.

RFM is also helpful for marketers to gain visibility into who their brand loyalists and champions are, 
who can be targeted in other campaigns like reward programs and promotions.

>### RFM分析
> RFM分别代表近期消费、购买频率、购买金额。它是一个市场营销模型，基于客户的历史数据对用户行为进行细分。
> 这些指标通过查看哪些是你的优质的客户，并且哪些客户导致了流失率，从而能帮助你决定使用哪种赢回策略。
> 
> 这些分析帮助市场人员回答如下问题：
> 
> 谁是你的优质客户，并且最活跃的用户（也即高级用户）？
> 
> 谁有潜力成为1个更有价值的客户？
> 
> 谁最有可能响应你的赢回策略？
> 
> 一旦这些问题找到答案，RFM分析能帮助决定哪些风险客户可能需要定位为赢回活动的目标。
> 
> RFM还可以帮助市场人员分辨谁是他们的品牌忠诚客户和支持客户，哪些客户需要采取例如奖励计划和促销的活动。

### 02. Make a Generous Offer
    
If you have customers that are either dormant or disengaged within the app itself, 
two strong options for reaching them are push notifications and email.

Tailoring messages specifically to a particular segment with a special offer is a great way to remind 
them that you’re still there. It’s simple for app developers to personalize push notifications 
with customer information such as location, or based on their previous transactions.

Consumers are more likely to make a purchase if they feel they’re getting a unique or special discount, 
especially if that offer is only good for a certain number of days. Clearly communicate in your push 
notification or email how long the offer stands.

> ### 给予一个慷慨大方的特价
> 假如你的app有沉默或者丢失的客户，两个有效的选择是通过推送消息通知和邮箱来触达他们。
> 为特定的用户群体发送量身定制的特价消息是1个非常好的方法，这个方法可以刷存在感。根据客户的地理信息或之前的交易，app开发者很容易定制化推送的消息。
> 
> 假如消费者感觉他获得了一个特别的折扣，那么他会非常可能进行消费，尤其是这个折扣仅仅在几天的有效期内。你需要在推送消息或者邮箱里清晰的告知特价的持续日期。
> 

### 03. Request Feedback and Take Action
Customer feedback is important for any company or organization to continue growing and improving. 
When developing an app, every feature and element will be discussed practically thousands of times by internal teams. 
Receiving customer feedback can offer new insights about the overall user experience with your product and what can be done
to improve it.

In-app surveys see an average 13% response rate, which makes them a great tool to capture real-time feedback 
from active users.

Once you’ve gathered information, it’s important to show users that their feedback is valuable. 
If you choose to implement any suggested changes, let your users know that you’re listening. 
You can include a message of thanks in your new feature announcements, or take it a step further and send a personalized 
email to show you appreciate the time they took to provide feedback.

> ### 请求用户反馈并采取行动

> 消费者反馈对于任何公司或组织的持续增长和改进都很重要。
> 当开发一个app时，每一个特征和元素都几乎会被内部小组讨论成千上百次。接收客户的反馈能提供给你新的关于用户体验和改进的见解。
> 
> 应用内调查能达到13%的响应率，这些说明调查问卷是实时获取活跃用户反馈的非常好的一个工具。
> 
> 一旦你收集到了信息，需要对客户表示他们的反馈是非常有价值的。假如你选择实施任何建议，让你的客户知道你正在倾听他们的反馈。
> 你可以在发布新特性时，使用一段消息来表示感谢。或者更进一步，发送一份定制化的邮件表达对他们提供反馈的感激。


### 04. Personalized Grand Finale

Every customer wants to feel like their voice is heard and their opinion matters. 
With the high cost of acquiring new customers, retaining your existing customer base should absolutely be a business priority.

Within email marketing, you can use personalization tactics to let subscribers know you’re paying attention. 
Include their name in the subject line and within the email body to show them you’re interested in their individual experience. 
You can also utilize user data and provide tailored offers based on their previous purchasing habits.

There is also opportunity to personalize the customer service experience. Provide them with a designated support
representative who is available to answer questions and troubleshoot any issues.

Offer multiple channels such as phone, live chat, or email to ensure all customers can reach a service representative 
in a way that is convenient for them.

> ### 个性化服务
> 每一个消费者都想要自己的内心的声音能够被听到，并且他们的建议能够起到作用。
> 为了获取新客户需要付出高昂的成本，所以保持你的存量客户才是完全值得提上商业营销优先级的事情。
> 
> 在电子邮件营销过程中，你可以使用个性化的策略，让你的邮件接收人知道你正在关注到他们。

> 
> 你仍然有机会个性化消费者服务过程，可以为他们提供专门的服务代表人，这样就能够回答问题并且分析各种问题。

### 01. Pokemon Go
<img src="/img/customer/winback/customer-winback-example-pokemon.jpeg">


Pokemon Go, a popular augmented reality mobile game, has had a record-breaking 
800 million downloads since they first launched in July of 2016. While they still have an 
estimated (and incredible) five million monthly active users, it is a drastic decline from the 
45 million that played when the game first launched

The game deploys a variety of push notifications in an effort to keep daily users coming 
back and re-engage lapsed or dormant users.

Whether it’s alerting users of rare Pokemon that will only be nearby for a limited time, 
or keeping track of daily battle streaks, these notifications are effective at getting users 
to open their app.

>### 01. 宝可梦GO

> 宝可梦GO,是一款流行增强现实的手机游戏。自从他们在2016年7月第一次发布以来，已经拥有了破纪录的8亿的下载量。
> 虽然他们只有大约5百万的月活用户，但是这对于有4千5百万的初始玩家数相比是大幅的下降。
> 
> 这款游戏发布了一系列推送通知，尝试保持日常用户的访问，并召回过期和沉默的用户。
> 
> 无论这些消息是提醒用户注意稀有的宝可梦，它们只会在附近停留一段时间，或是记录每天的战斗记录。这些通知非常有效的促使用户打开这款app。
> 

### 02. Postmates

It’s common practice for e-commerce brands to activate win-back strategies for customers 
who haven’t made a recent purchase. The popular food delivery app Postmates sends weekly emails 
to their subscribed users with deals and discounts, but sometimes these discounts are carefully planned.

In one instance, Postmates sent an email with the subject line, “Your Mystery Discount Is…” In order 
to receive their discount, users had to click a clearly marked button within the email body to open 
the app using a deferred link. Daily active users who clicked through received a hefty discount 
of 75% off their delivery fee, which any customer would be thrilled with.

The real jackpot was for inactive users, who would receive 100% off their delivery fee if they
clicked through the email. Giving your users generous offers whether they’re active or not, 
is a great way to keep your engagement (and retention) high.

> ### 02. 同城快递公司Postmates
> 一个电商品牌为最近没有采购的消费者采用赢回策略是一件非常普通的事情。这个流行的食物快递app Postmates，每周发送优惠和折扣的电子邮件给它的订阅者，

> 这个app。点击了的用户就能享受对配送费进行75折的折扣优惠，这肯定让消费者都激动不已。
> 
> 真正的大奖则是为了不活跃用户，如果他们点击了邮件，他们能接收到1次100%的折扣。不管你的用户是否活跃，给予他们巨大的优惠可以保持使用率和留存率较高的一个好办法。
